You are still eligible to submit the homeworks. However, be aware that there will be deadlines for turning in the final projects. So, it's recommended not to leave everything for the last minute.\\n\\nTo join the course, you need to register before the course starts. You can register using the provided link. Additionally, you should subscribe to the course's public Google Calendar (available only on Desktop) and join the course's Telegram channel for announcements. Don't forget to register in DataTalks.Club's Slack and join the channel as well.\\n\\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.\""
